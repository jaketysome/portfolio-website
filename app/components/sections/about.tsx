        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with expertise in building web
          applications using modern technologies. I have a strong background in
          both frontend and backend development, with a passion for creating
          clean, efficient, and scalable solutions to complex problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me making music, reading books about
          astronomy and physics, or hiking around the Peaks. I'm always looking
          to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
