        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with expertise in building web
          applications using modern technologies. I have a strong background in
          both frontend and backend development, with a passion for creating
          clean, efficient, and scalable solutions to complex problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or
          contributing to open-source projects. I'm always looking to learn new
          technologies and improve my skills.
