# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Vercel**. It showcases my professional and personal projects, provides access to my CV, and includes links to get in touch or explore more of my work.

## ✨ Features

- **About Section** – A short introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **Project Showcase** – A filterable gallery of selected projects:
  - Includes both professional and portfolio work
  - Each card features a project description, a live link, and a GitHub repo link (when available)
- **Downloadable CV** – Easily access and download a copy of my CV.
- **Contact Button** – Reach out via email with one click.
- **Social Links** – Quick access to my [GitHub](#) and [LinkedIn](#) profiles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), with automatic builds from the `main` branch.

## 🌱 Learning Notes

The initial design and layout were generated using **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, producing a static site in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. I then rebuilt the project using the modern **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind** stack. This conversion helped reinforce how modern frameworks map back to fundamental web technologies — a valuable learning process that deepened my understanding of both.

## 📂 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaketysome/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website
npm install
npm run dev

```
